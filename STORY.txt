you end up in a dark,scary forest :OOOO
75 to go deeper into it, 338 to try leaving it

75
there is a shallow siluete staring at you

12 to follow it 3 to go back

12
you find out it is your long gone sister who made fun of you when you were little
32 to talk to her 100 to hit her

338 
A blood fairy stops you. It puts you before two choices: either drink the dark water from the golden cup, or follow it to it's castle.
To drinkl from the cup go to 123, to follow it go to 20.


32
You talk to her and she says you have 3 seconds to run away or something bad will happen
324 tell her you want to make ammends with her 454 run away





123
You drank from the golden cup. The dark water made your vision blurry, you can barely see a thing. You fall to the ground and see the fairy dragging you through the forest. The rocks scratch your back, and your blood leaves a trace throughout the woods. You want to excape, pput you are paralised. What ya doing, try to escape again( go to 67), or let your eyelids guide you in a deep sleep(go to 90) ?
To drinkl from the cup go to 123, to follow it go to 20.


324
You try telling her you still love her but she turn out to be a skinwalker and eats you alive. You died
