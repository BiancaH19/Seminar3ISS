75
there is a shallow siluete staring at you

12 to follow it 3 to go back

12
you find out it is your long gone sister who made fun of you when you were little
32 to talk to her 100 to hit her

338 
A blood fairy stops you. It puts you before two choices: either drink the dark water from the golden cup, or follow it to it's castle.
To drinkl from the cup go to 123, to follow it go to 20.


32
You talk to her and she says you have 3 seconds to run away or something bad will happen
324 tell her you want to make ammends with her 454 run away

454
you try running away and she does not bother to run after you because she knows you are stupid and you will not find you way home
go to 876



123
You drank from the golden cup. The dark water made your vision blurry, you can barely see a thing. You fall to the ground and see the fairy dragging you through the forest. The rocks scratch your back, and your blood leaves a trace throughout the woods. You want to excape, pput you are paralised. 
What ya doing, try to escape again( go to 67), or let your eyelids guide you in a deep sleep(go to 90) ?



324
You try telling her you still love her but she turn out to be a skinwalker and eats you alive. You died

you indeed get lost in the woods
983 to scream for help 732 to sleep because you are tired
=======
You feel your eyelids getting heavier and you lose consciousness...... You wake up! You look around you and see that you are in a room, tied to a chair. 
19 to quietly inspect the room, 78 to shout for help




99
As you bend over to take the key She grabbed you by the arm. She shapeshifted and transformed into a creature that eat you.
You died!


19
YOU SEE YOUR DAD!!!!!!!!!! WHAT? He is the master mind behind all of these schananigans. He is in fact a Shapeshifter, and he was the blood fairy all this time. He makes you fight your sister(a shapeshifter too).
What is your weapon of choice: big a sword(266), a lasso(81).




37
You drag her toward the river, her feet scraping against the gravel. She pleads for mercy. 
If you want to push her into the river, go to 888.
If you want to hear her part of the storym go to 112.


983
you scream for help and there comes a man he shoots you in the belly because he wants to sleep and you are noisy. You obviosly die
end


111
You see an abbandoned village. A misty fog covers the surrounding.
800 Listen your instincts and go around
700 Go ahead and adventure in the forgotten village.
